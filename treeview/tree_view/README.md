In this Project, I am going to share with you how to display subdirectories and files in TreeView in C#.
This tree view control gives you the ability to control which drive types are displayed to let the user choose directories. A possible scenario is to show only local drives, because your application scans the selected directories and fills a database with the generated meta data, and it makes no sense to allow directories from removable drives.
There is search functionality which allows user to search a file inside the directory or subdirectory
